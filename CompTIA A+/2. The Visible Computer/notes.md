- Linux --> SU = Root

## Why Windows?
- Intel CPUs came with a copy of windows, back in the old days.
- Concept of Domain: A Windows Server OS, runs in a computer. Set's up as a domain controller, now then all other pc's connected with the network, will be able to access he login through the single computer. Active Directory! Single-Sign-On (SSO)!
- Samba - Linux
- File Sharing - MacOS
- SSO is owned by windows, and there is always a Windows Server setup, in every organization! In windows, you can connect to WorkGroup.
- In the large organizations, with the function of Active Directory, and Single Sign On (SSO), windows wins, and this is why windows!
